This is a customer app that powers the members.chowdy.ca. It provides a dashboard for customers to modify their weekly meal subscription, a section for chefs to update the menu, and admin dashboard for Chowdy admins to manage the customers.

There are scheduled weekly tasks that produces a series of reports and other critical info updates (total customer and meal numbers, customers that require delivery)

The app is currently deployed on Heroku, with Ruby 2.1.0, Rails 4.2, ad Postgres for database. The Heroku uses 1 web dyno to handle HTTP request, and 1 worker dyno to handle all scheduled jobs, receive Stripe webhooks, and send emails.
